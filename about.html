                <p>
                    My name is William Lachenal. I am married to an amazing woman that I do not deserve and 
                    together we have had three kids. My oldest is a boy, and his brother and sister 
                    are about three years younger than him. No, you did not read that wrong. We had twins.
                </p>

                    I was born in New Hampshire (Go Pats!) and lived there until I was about eight years old.
                    My parents then moved us to Florida where I remained through graduating High School. 
                    It was during my senior year that I started the process of joining the U.S. Navy. The 
                    following September I went off to boot camp. After bootcamp and my job's school I was sent
                    off to Naples, Italy where I lived for three years. My next duty station was Pearl-Harbor Hawaii,
                    where I also lived for three years. I got out of the military in March of 2020 and moved to where I currently live, in Texas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually met my wife that first year I moved to Florida, in the third grade. We started dating just before our senior year in High School and she was already planning to join the Navy and is a large part of what got me to join myself. She left for bootcamp just two months before I did. Her first duty station ended up being in Japan though. So we ended up doing something pretty rare, we did a double proxy marriage. Our marriage certificate is from Big Fork, Montana. At the time I was in Italy and my wife was somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.

                    My wife and I have three kids, separated by three years and 15 minutes. My oldest is a boy and then 
                    we had fraternal, girl-boy twins. We also have two dogs. An old rescued mutt and a very young black lab.

                        Outside of my amazing family, I am a giant nerd at heart. I love playing video games and reading epic fantasy series. I had a friend get me into the world of building custom gaming PC's and no console feels good enough anymore. I spend a lot of time in online multiplayer games but that doesn't diminish my love for the single player experience. My favorite single player experiences, in no particular order, are 'Last Of Us', 'Balder's Gate 3', and 'Witcher 3'. As for multiplayer games, I spend a majority of that time playing Old School Runescape.

                        When I'm not gaming there is a good chance I'll be reading. I am a big fan of the fantasy genre. I ended up reading Rob Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' because of a friend's suggestion and I fell absolutely in love.  It is THE fantasy book series. It was through this series that I was introduced to Brandon Sanderson and his work. Sanderson finished the Wheel of Time series after Jordan passed away.
