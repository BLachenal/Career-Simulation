                <p>
                    My name is William Lachenal. I am married to an amazing woman that I do not deserve and 
                    together we have had three kids. My oldest is a boy, and his brother and sister 
                    are about three years younger than him. No, you did not read that wrong. We had twins.

                    I was born in New Hampshire (Go Pats!) and lived there until I was about eight years old.
                    My parents then moved us to Florida where I remained through graduating High School. 
                    It was during my senior year that I started the process of joining the U.S. Navy. The 
                    following September I went off to boot camp. After bootcamp and my job's school I was sent
                    off to Naples, Italy where I lived for three years. My next duty station was Pearl-Harbor Hawaii,
                    where I also lived for three years. I got out of the military in March of 2020 and moved to where I currently live, in Texas. 
                </p>

                    I actually met my wife that first year I moved to Florida, in the third grade. We started dating just before our senior year in High School and she was already planning to join the Navy and is a large part of what got me to join myself. She left for bootcamp just two months before I did. Her first duty station ended up being in Japan though. So we ended up doing something pretty rare, we did a double proxy marriage. Our marriage certificate is from Big Fork, Montana. At the time I was in Italy and my wife was somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.
